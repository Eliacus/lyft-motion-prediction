# Lyft motion prediction challenge

A repository for the code used for my submission to lyft motion prediction challenge at Kaggle.

In this project, a resnest-50 model was implemented in pytorch lightning along with a custom datamodule for the lyft l5 dataset, which is built ontop of the l5kit API. Notebooks were created to explore the data and visualize the predictions of the model.
